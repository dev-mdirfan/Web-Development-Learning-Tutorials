# Introduction
## 1. How web works ?
* Two types of websites -
    * Static
    * Dynamic

### Static Website -
* Static Website whose data are not in control by user
    * Can't do changes
    * When want to add a new web page you have to do Additional coding
    * Limited no. of pages
* Its like a visiting card which will only shows content
    * **Example -** 
        * Landing Pages of a company
        * Resume website 

### Dynamic Website -
* A website in which control of data by users and clients
* Most websites serve by Dynamic Website
* In fact, YouTube also has a dynamic website
* `Frontend` + `Database` + `Server site Language` = Website Ready (but still in computer) 
* Need to give a `Unique Name`(Domain) + `A computer which runs 24/7`(Hosting)
* Now, you have a live website in which anyone can access in the world
* Need to do extra like add payment gateway


## 2. Basic web Technologies (HTML CSS JS)  ?
* Suppose our website is a human body in which bones are simulate skeleton which defines shapes an size (here skeleton is HTML)
* In above of skeleton, we have muscles, skin, hair which defines esthetic look of the any body similarly we use CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) which create looks and style of the websites.
* Now our body has no any functionality, it can't think so for that we use programming language JavaScript which acts as a brain

## 3. What is Frontend ?
* **Note -** Here JavaScript does not have a memory because `HTML` + `CSS` + `JavaScript` all installed in the browser, therefore it called as `Frontend` or `Client Site`

## 4. What is Backend ?
* So for the memory and storage we use `Database` and `Server`.
### What is Database ?
* Database is used for store the data efficiently.
    * Whenever you register on any website that data is stored on any server so that you login again
### What is Server ?
* Server is a powerful computer which lies on any data center
* Because of Frontend lies on the any browser and you can even rent servers.
* That browser can be used in any device (Phone, Tablet or Laptop). Here speed of the devices can be slow, therefore for process data we use server and so in server we use server site language (Java, PHP, Python). We also use these languages for interaction with database.
* Your fully functional body is ready, now we need unique name for that and this is known as `Domain Name`. And that has a identity of that website and this is also used to call the server then further website's content visible

### What happen when a website is written in web address and call -
* When a website is called and their domain name locate the server then your request send on the server then server request database queries then website's content shows to web browser
* Then browser jobs to read the contents which has in HTML, and that create layout, using CSS it makes design, using JavaScript it makes functionality.
